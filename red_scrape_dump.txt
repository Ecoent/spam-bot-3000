-Mar31 05:27SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/62ivl8/top_10_trivia_app_idea/SUBM_TXTI have started to create a trivia app similar to [Fight List](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.two4tea.fightlist&hl=en). It's basically the same thing but it's just a top 10 list for each round and the player earns more points for the higher up answers in the top 10. Example: Top 10... Largest US States by AreaTexas = 10 pointsCalifornia = 9 points...Wyoming = 1 pointWhat do you guys think about this idea? Is top 10 a bad idea?I'm starting to feel like it might take too much time to gather and mange top 10 info. Also there might not be that many top 10's out there that aren't always changing.

-Mar25 22:38SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/61hpor/just_bought_my_4th_android_and_want_to_change_all/SUBM_TXTHi guys, (disclaimer: Sorry if this is the wrong sub and I checked the wiki but couldn't see anything like this)So I realised that I've basically just pootled along with whatever worked when I gave up ios 10 years ago and didn't understand android. Now that I've got a new Sony zx I realised this is the perfect time to streamline how I use android. For example, I've been using aviate launcher because it works and is pretty minimal. But I've spent the afternoon looking at nova and its crazy feature list and have to give this a go: customise my os to my behaviors, choose my preferred designs etc. Rather than having it spoon fed to me.So what are your Android pro tips? Automation? Preferred dialers? Keyboards? Camera apps? Media players? Things I don't even know about?! Thanks you guys!

Looking for an app (android) that can help with daily tasks/reminders. If possible, also able to access it on computer I don't know that it would necessarily be a to do list in the sense that many are reoccurring tasks, some on certain days, others not so much, but I could be wrong. I don't need it down to the level of 'brush teeth' and 'eat' but more like from 5:30-7:00 is study time, 9:00-9:15 plan tomorrow, etc. I would appreciate and and all feedback as well as open to any suggestions on helping with this.

-Feb28 23:43SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal/comments/5wr0fi/bought_an_iphone_and_completely_stopped_using_my/SUBM_TXTI recently switched from iPhone from Android and it's made me stop journaling. I had been using my journal for about 8 months and I haven't used it for at least a month. On the Android system everything felt so separate but with iOS everything feels connected. I can make pretty detailed lists and quick to do lists in notes, the reminder system is great and the calander system is workable.I'm feeling guilty for not using my beloved paper journal but it's so much easier for me to just tap out a quick grocery list or easily update my budget note! My favorite part, and something that was bothering me about my paper journal, is that once I'm done with the list I can just swipe and delete it. It's not sitting around taking up space that I have to see everyday once it's not relevant.I guess it's a form of journaling, and I feel bad for abandoning my actual journal but it works for me and that's what's important!
-Apr01 00:50SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/62orky/my_seven_realms_of_minimal_living_thoughts_and/SUBM_TXTOver the last decade I’ve taken steps to simplify my life. I’m sharing the architecture of the process in the hope it helps other ordinary folks. I’m not a “digital nomad,” I’m not self-employed, and I’m not a coastal elite. What I am is a Midwestern, city-dwelling, happily single dude--nearing 40--who works full-time at a retail store for a modest wage plus good benefits (admittedly lucky in this regard).Here are the main “components” of what works for me:1. **Car-free life**. I live in Milwaukee. While it’s not a transit mecca, the bus system works well for me, as I rarely want/need to visit the suburbs. I gave up my car over 12 years ago. In that time I’ve lived in Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul, and Milwaukee. While it sometimes takes me longer to get places, I use the time to read, go online, and engage with city sights. I never stress about winter driving. I’m also freed from worrying about car maintenance, car theft, parking, registration, insurance, washing, etc. I spend $72 a month for a transit pass and use Uber a few times a month to supplement when needed (average $30-35/month). In addition, I’ve discovered the joys of walking, not merely to get places but as a pursuit of its own. I’m just a few blocks from Lake Michigan and enjoy watching the sunrise. Love the lake fog too.2. **Studio apartment life**. I grew up in a conventional house and have lived in giant apartments with roommates (esp. in Chicago), but my favorite places were cozy studios, including my current one--about 350 sq ft. It’s an older brick building w/ HWF (my style) and heat included. This is plenty of room. I don’t want to have people over; the city is my entertainment room. Since rent is comparatively cheap in Milwaukee, I can afford to live in a nice, vibrant area. My furnishings consist of Ikea-esque basics: bed, desk/table (it’s both!), chair, nightstand, and bookshelf. Everything matches nicely, but I don’t obsess over any of it and all of it was pretty cheap. I could leave it all behind and lose no more than $300-400 if I ever moved to another city. I have no interest in home ownership and disagree strongly that renting is throwing money away, but that's a whole different, contentious discussion for another time.3. **Wardrobe**. I work a job that doesn’t require dressing up, so work and non-work clothes are the same. My biggest insight was unifying everything around black and grey. All pants and socks and shoes are either black or grey. The rest are tees, hoodies, and cardigans--all perfectly interchangeable. And no white, ever. I wash my clothes once a week. It all fits in a double-load washer with my sheets (2 sets, 1 in use, 1 backup), blanket, and towels (3, one in use, 2 backups). I go to a local laundromat a few blocks from home instead of using the machines in my building--because the laundromat is predictable and I never have to worry about having quarters. I used to hate laundry, but now I look forward to the routine. One secret of minimal living is to develop and enjoy routines.4. **Low-maintenance job**. I do have a graduate degree in public policy and used to have a better-paying but more stressful job. I was never making big money (in the mid-40s), but I used to spend money needlessly as a way of coping. Now I work full-time at a store. I enjoy what I do and have fabulous and fun coworkers. I don’t supervise anyone, and the rare difficult situation at work can be passed off to the management. I work hard while there, but I never fret about work situations and feel no worry or burden the moment I walk out the door. Although my income is low, my bills are also low--rent, electric, internet, transit pass, and a small student loan payment. I carry no CC balance. I am lucky enough to work for a business that offers good benefits--vacation, sick time, 401k w/ matching, and low-cost medical, dental, and vision, all of which offset the low pay. I have a cushion for emergencies and apparently more savings than most Americans. I have student loans from my master’s degree, but the payments are manageable. Luckily, I have no loans from undergrad due to having a scholarship. (Btw, I have zero regrets about earning a BA in a liberal arts field; I was just lucky enough to attend a good private school for free. If I were paying for undergrad myself, I would’ve still studied English; I just would’ve attended an in-state university. To me, the timeless, holistic quality of my undergraduate education has been of more "use" than the hyper-careerist graduate education I received. Just my two cents.)5. **Entertainment**. My hobbies are admittedly inexpensive. I read books, I listen to music, I go for walks, I hang out at coffeeshops, and I dick around online. I eat out with friends, but we rarely go anywhere too expensive. Drinking isn’t a big part of my life (maybe 6-8 times a year and never more than a few drinks), and I don’t smoke pot or use other drugs. I take advantage of free and low-cost events in the city, such as free museum days, street festivals, university lectures, open houses, etc. I go to the occasional baseball game (cheap seats are fine!). Sometimes I travel, but I don’t have the urge for this that many people do.6. **Simple Food**. I don’t like cooking. I really don’t enjoy grocery shopping or food preparation/cleanup, so I focus on simple meals (often frozen) and things that require no preparation, such as yogurt, nuts, fruit, breads, cheese, crackers, hummus, veggies, and cured meats like salami. I wouldn’t call my diet especially healthy or unhealthy. I also have no shame in eating fast food; a $1 sausage biscuit from McD’s is hard to beat for quick breakfast on the way to work.7. **Technology**. I use a low-to-mid range Android phone w/ Virgin (mine was $99) that works great for my needs, along with a convertible Acer Chromebook. I found that keeping everything in the Google/Android world is very freeing. For music I use Spotify Premium ($10 a month) which has almost everything I’ve ever searched for. For the rest, there’s YouTube. I don’t own any CDs or vinyl. I also don’t own any DVDs or video game stuff (not into movies, not into gaming). I subscribe to Amazon Prime for the free shipping, however.**Tl;dr**: I’m laughing at the length of this post, but I’ve simplified nearly all aspects of my life and feel happier, more intellectually stimulated, more secure financially, and less stressed. I boil it down to these seven "realms."

You can request 5 icons at a time (to limit spam) to be themed, however due the number of request only highly requested apps will be themed for the upcoming updates.Premium Request are for individuals who REALLY want their missing icons themed. Their request will be prioritized and their icons will be themed in the upcoming updates. Side Note: If you want to submit a premium request, request your small non-popular apps as popular apps will be themed as time goes on due to regular requests. I am also working on a new project, that has yet to be announced but here is a sneak preview (http://imgur.com/a/2Zvrv). I would love to know your thoughts on these icons.Thanks for reading! If you have any questions fell free to leave them below, ill try my best to answer as many of them.

-Apr01 23:10SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/62viri/help_with_finding_a_methodapp_to_keep_on_top_of/SUBM_TXTHi! I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed by tasks at work, and I'm seeking advice on a method to keep on top of everything so I can succeed at my job. How do you all keep on top of your projects? Does your method involve integrating different apps into one system? What would you recommend for me to try?In general, my work consists of days in the office mixed with days in the field, some meetings but not a huge amount, a mix of large tasks and 5-minute tasks, and lots of changes in priority between tasks as new items come up. Things I want in my ideal system/app:* Ability to break things out into various lists based on: priority, task size, topic, whether I can do it out of the office, etc -- A task should appear on all the lists that it's assigned to. * I also like the KanBan system of dividing tasks by current status (On Docket, Doing, Need Assistance, Done). * A way of assigning tasks to be done today/tomorrow* A time-keeping system (currently I'm using Toggl to track my time, but it would be nice to have it attached to specific tasks)* Ability to track what I finished on what day and also how long I’ve had a task in my court* Archive of completed tasks so I can go back and see what I did* Has an Android app so I can check it on the go* This is for my personal use, so I don't need any collaboration functionality* Productivity insights would be nice (like how long I spent doing a certain task type, or which day of the week I got the most accomplished), but I can always just calculate these on my own.* I am willing to pay for an app if it's good enough, although of course free would be betterThings I've tried:* Paper: I love writing things by hand, but paper-based systems (including bujo) just can't keep up with my changing priorities and huge number of to-dos.* Google Calendar: Good for blocking out chunks of time to work on something, but hard to keep track of tiny tasks.* To-Do Apps: Wunderlist, Todoist, and Google Keep just haven't stuck in my work life -- I feel like I need more functionality, and so want a true project management app.* Trello: I like how easy it is to move tasks between lists on a board and the color-coding system, but it just didn't have the ability to break things out into enough different lists/categories for me. * Lanes.io: This has come the closest to what I want, but it just feels kind of laggy and unfinished to me. I think my ideal app is very similar to Lanes but more polished. Things on my list to try: MeisterTask, Taiga, Scoro, Nostromo, Taskworld, Getplan.co

[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/5zwyv1/which_news_app_do_you_use/df1p46h/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/5zwyv1/which_news_app_do_you_use/df218c1/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/5lfzck/breaking_news_apps/dbvfnlh/)So, tell us, what features are a must-have for you in a news app? **Please post a separate top-level comment for each feature; that way, others can upvote them** and we can assess them better.For now, Hermit has the following features that make it ideal for news:* [Notifications from RSS and Atom feeds](https://hermit.chimbori.com/features/notifications), which many newspapers already have. If you install your Lite Apps from our curated Library (instead of creating them yourself), then the feeds are all automatically configured for the most popular news sites & sources.* [Automatic AMP Redirection](https://hermit.chimbori.com/features/amp), for the fastest reading experience on mobile (without many of the annoyances that are seen when using AMP directly from Google Search).* [Reader Mode](https://hermit.chimbori.com/features/reader) that works for almost all news sites.* [Night Mode](https://hermit.chimbori.com/features/night-mode); quite obvious what it does, but we’d like to stress that this works even with Web Mode (not just Reader Mode, unlike some other apps).* And of course Ad Blocking, natively supported without plugins. We generate our block list from [13 of the most popular ones](https://github.com/chimbori/lite-apps/blob/master/blocklists/index.json) and push it to your app regularly without having to update the full app.If you’d like us to add more news sources, let us know, we’re always looking to expand our [Hermit Library catalog](https://hermit.chimbori.com/library/).
-Mar16 21:43SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/5zssw2/gboard_not_autocorrecting_i_to_i/SUBM_TXTThis is so frustrating, it started happening out of nowhere. I'm running a SIM free HTC 10 on Nougat. I haven't got the lower case i in my dictionary. Whenever i type i, the middle suggestion comes up as the capitalised I, so it should be autocorrecting it. Other words autocorrect perfectly. I've tried uninstalling, clearing all the app data / cache etc and it still does it. SwiftKey / any other keyboard works perfectly. Is this a bug or what?Interestingly, if i keep hitting i and then space, it starts correcting it apart from the 2nd and 4th ones, worth noting it capitalises the first.I i I i I I I I I I I I I see what i mean?I i I i I I I I I I I I I Update - From the comments it has become apparent that this is a bug with the English UK dictionary. I've sent an email to the address listed on the app's Play Store page, I'll let you know if i hear anything. Feel free to contact Google through any channels I may be unaware of.

-Mar16 03:02SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/5znjs3/request_alarm_app_that_can_open_an_arbitrary_app/SUBM_TXTI want to do the following:1. Set an alarm2. When I turn off the alarm, open a todo list (or TODO app)3. The TODO app would ideally have three features- Multiple TODO lists- After a list is done, I can set it up to open another list automatically- After a list is done, I can set it up to reappear as a blank list the next dayThe main feature I want is being able to open the app automatically after an alarm. My built in alarm app can do this with a limited set of apps, but not with an arbitrary app. Hence the question. (And I suppose that if there is a TODO app with an alarm built in, that would work as well).I haven't been able to find such an app. Do people here have suggestions?
-Mar14 19:40SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/5zdlq2/dev_grammarpal_an_app_that_checks_your_texts_for/SUBM_TXTHi everyone, I made GrammarPal, an app that helps you find and fix errors in your texts. Unlike the spell checker in your phone, this app aims to also find all other kinds of grammatical errors. GrammarPal works with devices on Android lollipop and above.[Get the app on the Play Store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kizitonwose.grammarchecker)Here are GrammarPal's core features:* Scan your texts for errors directly from any app.* Instantly see the number of errors in your text after the scan.* Replace errors with the correct words or phrases.* Add new words to your custom dictionary so they don't show as errors.* Choose the kind of errors you want the app the app to ignore.* Disable error checking in any app by adding the app to your blacklist.* [Android 6.0+] Check only a portion of your text by selecting the part you want to check and choosing "check for errors" on the text selection toolbar.&nbsp;Note that this app uses [LanguageTool.org](https://languagetool.org)'s API to check your text for errors and is therefore only as smart as LanguageTool in terms of error checking. Also note that "sending automated requests" is against LanguageTool's API [terms of service](http://wiki.languagetool.org/public-http-api) which is why you have to interact with the floating button to scan your text. &nbsp;If you find any bugs or have ideas for new features, feel free to contact me. If you love the app, please spare a minute to leave a review on the Play Store.
-Mar15 01:25SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/5zfrlw/request_browser_that_works_like_erebus_minus_the/SUBM_TXTTitle. I used Erebus briefly, because the "on the fly" red HTML filter/recolor made browsing the web in dimly lit locations very nice. I frequent these types of environments, and generally having a lot of light glaring from a device isn't a good idea. So with the red light mode browser, I could quickly search and read documentation without lighting up the area around me, as well as heavily reducing eye strain. The blistering dark red colors were pleasant to look at it, even when my sight was fatigued.I was wondering if there is any app out there that does exactly what Erebus (find here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urysoft.darknessreader) does, but without the history function and if possible, a faster rendering engine (NOT Android WebKit). I really like the way Erebus works. I really do. And I'd love to support the devs. Allow me to elaborate.1. I absolutely cannot stand the fact that the browser remembers **everything** you do. Part of this problem is the way it handles navigation. But you can exit the browser, and it will remember the last webpage you were on (super annoying to me, I'm honestly not sure why though). The default homepage (which can be changed later) is Google, and if you typed something into Google's search bar, it will stay there as a previously typed suggestion. What's even funnier is that there's no history related settings in the app. I already emailed the devs using the email address provided on the Play Store, and they responded within the hour. They told me that Erebus doesn't remember history at all, and I must be doing something wrong. ^^Eeeennnnhhhhh.... no.2. There is no formal navigation. You enter a URL in the address bar, and it will take you to that site. You can go to Google, search something, and navigate to a web page. But there's no forward button. So the only thing you can do is...^go ^^back, ^^^go ^^^^back, ^^^^^go ^^^^^^back.Essentially, it's a decent enough browser, but with the faults listed above I can't bring myself to continue using it. The fact that it uses the slow stock rendering engine is just icing on the cake, and wouldn't be such a big negative to me if the other problems were dealt with first. And I even considered buying a donation package via IAP to unlock more color schemes but I've read through the comments on the Play Store and some people were reporting problems with the IAP not unlocking anything and remaining at the "evaluation" or "trial" mode in the app.I realize that for lots of people, history isn't a big deal. And the developer doesn't owe me anything. But if there's something out there that works like what I described, I'd much rather my money go to that developer for *it* compared to Erebus. Sorry for the wall of text, and thanks in advance.

-Mar13 14:02SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/5z4l9a/dev_a_word_search_app_highly_customizable_to/SUBM_TXTHello everyone,I'am here today to present to you my second game I made and published, a Word Search app.I aim mainly at the Amazon Underground marketplace because the game is completely free there, so here is a link to it:**[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Fat-Fun-Games-Classic-Search/dp/B01G75HV62/ref=sr_1_3?s=mobile-apps&ie=UTF8&qid=1489404571&sr=1-3)**But the app is still in the Google Play : [Google Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FatFunGames.WordSearch.google)My goal with this game as it was with the Sudoku one ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Fat-Fun-Games-Classic-Sudoku/dp/B01ADJHCQC/ref=sr_1_2?s=mobile-apps&ie=UTF8&qid=1489405114&sr=1-2) | [Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FatFunGames.ClassicSudoku.google)), was to offer as many options as I could.- The Word Search app takes all the options that were available in the Sudoku and adds more to them, from customizing backgrounds, text colors, line colors to more options aimed at the Word Search game itself:- First of all, I offer 2 difficulty/puzzle sizes, QuickFix which contains 30 words spread across a 14x14 board AND BigBoard which has 70 words across a 32x32 board.- Other difficulty option to allow or not allow diagonal words or backwards words. Along with the board size, these can really help tweak the difficulty to your liking.- Fade lines for visibility, this popped in my head while working on the game. Sometimes when you find lots of words, the lines across the letters can make the vision of the letters quite difficult. So when you enable this option, the lines fade down to a certain opacity after a while.- Highlight vowels: I really love this one. This applies a specific color to each vowel and colors them in the board, which helps spot and identify each vowel when looking for words.- Aesthetics and beauty wise, we have Rainbow lines and Rainbow letters, when you swipe across letters with these options enables, you get different colors for the lines and the letters. Makes the board nice and colorful :p.- This one is a feature more than an option, it's quite awesome really. When you press and hold on a letter, a feature gets triggered that makes the word list only show words that contain that letter. It's really great when you use it for a while and really get used to it.I think that was a good presentation of the game. My goal here is to try and drive some new dedicated players to the games, reach more audiance by presenting my games as best as I can to the relevant subreddits.To be honest, with how big the markets are, it really is difficult to make a name for yourself, so I'm trying every option that comes to my mind.So guys, Feel free to leave any critic, advice or any kind of feedback. I hope you give the amazon version a go. And if you can find it in your heart, give the game a chance, share it with your friends, leave a review to express your thoughts on it because these little baby reviews mean a lot to the apps :p. And hey, if you like it, make it a part of your daily routine, play a puzzle with your coffee, while on the bus maybe.Anyway, thank you for reading, and see you later.Bye
-Mar12 16:47SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/5yyzak/dev_lucidity_learn_lucid_dreaming_new_update_and/SUBM_TXTHi all,I'm the developer of [Lucidity](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.b3nz.lucidity), an android app that helps you keep a dream journal and helps you lucid dream.I've posted in this subreddit in the past and today I'm very happy and excited to announce a new update to the app. Everything has been rewritten from scratch which will let me build new features that weren't possible before.A beta-test is being launched before the official release and you are welcomed to join it now by clicking [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/ch.b3nz.lucidity).

-Mar11 21:47SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/5yut4s/dev_chromer_17_is_here_with_major_over_haul_and/SUBM_TXT## Chromer 1.7Hi all, I am developer of Chromer and today I am excited to present you Chromer's biggest update dubbed **Anniversary update** since its inception last year.**TLDR: Major design changes, history option, web view fallback, AMP support and awesome looking Article mode.**###A little intro to Chromer:Chromer started as a utility app to ***launch Chrome Custom Tabs system-wide*** without any changes required from the app side. What is CCT you ask? It's basically a light weight tab of Google Chrome that developers can call and display content efficiently in their app. It also *shared the Cookie-jar* with Google Chrome meaning all your saved passwords and form info are shared as well. The only catch was each app had *to do it manually and that's where Chromer came in.* That was it, nothing more.Since it has to **register as a browser** to do the CCT thing, naturally comparisons were made and expectations were high, I have since released multiple updates and Chromer has come a long way. *This is the 30th update.*----------In this post, ***I as a developer*** will explain how **recent changes and additions in 1.7** could help improve your browsing experience in general. 1. **The usage of CCT itself:** Chrome Custom Tabs exposes a window to actual Chrome and gives us devs a limited window to provide customizations. Your login information is shared, **data saver, bookmarks and history all sync with your Google account** and you can basically *use any Chromium based browsers like Brave (adblock) and even Samsung Internet released recently.* Visually I have implemented **dynamic toolbar color based on app and website** and also **a bottom bar with extra options**. Since Google Sync API is closed to 3rd party, Chromer remains as the 3rd party browser to provide sync ability by using Custom Tabs. Google Chrome also started using custom tabs but one could *try out Chromer for the myriad of customization options.*   2. **Entering the bubble territory - Web heads:** Originally established by the great Chris Lacy's Link bubble, Chromer was flooded with requests to add bubble support. Given the limited customizations allowed, I finally implemented bubble browsing with Custom tab itself and it has standard feature set like **Favicons and smooth animations.** Optionally you can turn on **Aggressive background loading** which allows you stack multiple links  loading them in background while you browse on other stuff. This causes a flicker due to technical limitation but it works.###**The new stuff and becoming a mobile first browser - AMP and Article mode.**####**AMP:** Aside from a **major design overhaul**, Chromer now supports mobile first standard called the ***Accelerated Mobile Pages***. AMP was basically brought to improve mobile browsing experience by a huge margin. Pages load upto 4x faster and generally it's great for static content. Chrome now has first party support. The problem it tries to solve is that, even though AMP is gaining adoption it is used in less places. Google search does it but outside of it, not so much. ***Chromer when you open a link, prefers AMP version of the page thus loading much faster and better.*** [DEMO -  AMP and NON AMP Page loading](http://imgur.com/a/lINgx)####**Article MODE**:*I save the best for the last.* Chromer now has a brand new reader mode called the **Article mode**. Basically **it removes all unnecessary content and removes ads and displays only the content you are looking for**. And does this in style in a sweet looking material designed activity.[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/gnett)[DEMO](http://imgur.com/a/W34OS)**Article mode is my personal favorite** and I am thrilled to guess how it ll be received here.[Ofcourse, article mode and amp works very well with web heads mode.](http://imgur.com/a/UMWFj)----------####**The set default browser button.**I as the dev, realize this is a very big ask. Hence Chromer makes it easy for you by providing  1. Secondary browser option 2. A blacklist option where you can set certain apps to launch links in secondary browser. 3. Quick Toggles for 7.0 for AMP, Article and web heads. 4. Favorite share option etc.That's it folks, let me know what you think and let's discuss.

-Mar10 22:35SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/5yowq8/dev_forcedoze_now_supports_nougat_and_adds_many/SUBM_TXTHey all,You probably remember my app [ForceDoze](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4iv8x5/i_made_forcedoze_to_force_enable_doze_mode_and/), which I shared on Reddit 10 months back. I got a lot of positive feedback and it helped LOTS of people extend their battery life on their Marshmallow device.Many of you have been wondering why I stopped working on the app and why the app didn't support Nougat. I got busy with university life and studies, and hence didn't had the time to update the app to support Nougat and fix bugs. Recently, I've had some free time so I've been working on a big update since the past month and it's been in beta testing for a while, and today I have updated the app to v1.4.0, which adds many new features.### What's new in ForceDoze* Nougat support *obviously* (if you're unrooted, then you need to grant `android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` to the app via ADB)* QuickTile and App Shortcuts support on Nougat. You can use the QuickTile to quickly toggle ForceDoze on or off. If you're on 7.1, you can use app shortcuts to quickly access ForceDoze settings and battery stats.* Doze Tunables support: You can use this feature to modify Light and Deep doze parameters. This will disable ForceDoze, because ForceDoze overrides those values to force the device into doze. (**Requires root**, but you can still copy the ADB command and share it)* Doze notification blocklist: There are apps that can send high-priority FCM notifications to your device and those notifications can bypass Doze. Some of those apps abuse high-priority FCM messaging and send a lot of notifications and that can drain your battery. You can use this feature to block such apps while your device is in Doze. **Requires root*** Doze app blocklist: Some poorly designed apps (and their background services) can continue to drain your battery even when your device is dozing. You can use this feature to block such apps while your device is in Doze. **Requires root*** Chinese (Traditional) translation - Thanks to osk2 on GitHub* Privacy policy* Many bug fixes and improvements (full changelog in the app)### Is ForceDoze still relevant on Nougat?I would say yes, while Nougat still puts your device into Doze mode even when you're moving, this "Light" state is not as effective as the "Deep" state. ForceDoze will put your device directly into Deep state and keep it there until you turn on your device.On top of that, ForceDoze offers many customization options and features to make the inbuilt Doze feature even more effective and useful.If you're still not happy with your battery life on Nougat, consider using ForceDoze!### DownloadForce Doze is a **free** & **open-source** app without any annoying ads, so you can grab the app and the source code from:* **Play Store:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.suyashsrijan.forcedoze* **Github:** https://github.com/theblixguy/ForceDoze* **Latest APK:** https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=457095661767143177Please let me know if you spot any bugs or unwanted behavior, or would like me to add more features to the app! I will be pushing out some updates over the next few days as I continue to fix any existing bugs and clean up my code (code duplication issues and other things).

I remember days spent trying to be productive only to realize at the end of the day that I just have spend my time doing something else.&nbsp;After reading the "7 habits of highly effective people", I was inspired to start prioritizing the things by what is urgent and what is actually important. So much so that I decided to make an android app for it. &nbsp;Rather than just making a list of things to be done and doing them randomly, my app sorts them based on the importance and urgency per habit 3 of Dr. Covey’s book, so as to make sure I get the important done first. &nbsp;If this is a system or app that interest you at all, you can check it out here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dejiapps.a4do&nbsp;I would love to hear what you guys think about it too.
-Mar23 16:44SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/6129pc/methodandroid_only_use_another_on_your_phone_to/SUBM_TXTIf you are running Lollipop or above, you usually have the ability to create multiple users on your phone. If an app is indeed essential for your life, but you find yourself checking it too often, you can create new account and install the apps in there, or use the new account as your "productivity account", with some basic apps installed to get work done. The benefit of using this technique is other user's apps are totally inactive, so you don't get any notifications, nor do they consume any battery power or network data. Hope this could be useful to some people. AFAIK there's no similar way of doing this on iOS (I was an iPhone user last year) except getting 2 seperate phones :D

-Feb21 01:55SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/5v8iat/decluttering_a_cloud_music_collection/SUBM_TXTI'm sure everyone can relate to this one in some way or another. I went through a period of major musical discovery as a teenager and in a fortunate combination of my own tech savviness and diligent backups, every album I begged, borrowed or stole from the age of 13+ has made it into my current collection well organised and at a decent quality bitrate.I was able to jump on Google's Play Music cloud music matching/storage service as soon as it came in beta in 2011, which was an amazing way to reclaim hundreds of GB storage on my hard drives. Ever since I haven't needed to even think about how much space my music collection takes up. It has ballooned to 800+ albums worth because with a subscription it's just so gosh darned easy to add albums to your library. Hear a song I like when I'm out? I'll get Google Now to tell me what it is and in one tap the whole album it is in has been added to the hoard! I'll hear a classic song in the background of a TV show and think "man, I should listen to those guys more" and tap -  their best of is in my library. But wait, their best of doesn't even have that one song which sparked this on it? Well, that album goes in too!So, onto the problem: I got my hands on a single in-ear Bluetooth earpiece recently so have found myself listening to my music collection at work a lot. I've been trying to listen by shuffling my whole collection but I often find myself skipping through 10+ tracks before I even find one I recognize, let alone want to listen to. One way around this has been to only listen to my "favorited" tracks on shuffle, but I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of music I love but never got around to giving the thumbs up (a feature only implemented a couple years ago) as occasionally I'll stumble upon them on my shuffling journeys. The standard digital music decluttering advice is usually to go through and find tracks which have never been listened to, but GPM only started syncing listen counts a couple months back (it used to only record listens from within the webapp, but 95% of my listening is through the Android client; and this is before we even start to think about the 7+ years of listen counts not preserved during the move to the cloud) so I'll end up doing exactly what I don't want to here and getting rid of stuff I love but has been buried in the mountain of stuff I don't! Has anybody managed to deal with their digital musical mountain high up in the cloud? How did you tackle it?

-Aug27 18:48SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/3im8pa/college_students_would_you_use_this_app/SUBM_TXTHello all,I'm the developer of Slide for Reddit and have recently started College, and have noticed a lack of good scheduling/homework apps on the Play Store. My solution would be Spiral, a material designed daily class/homework planner.It would be really simple to use. You input all your classes and class information (location, room number, professor, professor info, blackboard URL,  class times, etc), and you would be greeted with a scrolling page list of all your classes. In each page, it would have the time till next class, a list of currently assigned homework, and a list of your friend's contacts in your class. You would click an FAB to add a homework assignment, and it would allow you to add due date, blackboard URL, description, and title. When you click on a homework assignment from the class view, it would open the homework view which would show time until due (ex: 3 hours 10 minutes! or 3 days), along with applicable information. You would have the option to mark the homework as complete, and once the class time passes, the homework item goes away if completed (if not, it'll show that the assignment is late!).From the class screen, you can also open up professor view which would show navigation to their office, office hours, and email address. The class view would have a location as well, allowing you to navigate to it if you are lost. This would all be material designed and ad-free, of course :).EDIT: Some mocups http://imgur.com/a/9NPzVLet me know what you think!
-May04 20:04SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/4hvrnz/seeing_a_speedcharge_lockscreen_with_ads/SUBM_TXTHello, I hope you are doing well.Since late 2015, and primarily starting in March 2016, multiple Android app developers have added "booster" services to their apps, commonly displayed as SpeedCharge, BoostCharge, and DU Battery Booster. These adware-like services up when your Android smartphone is charging. It displays the date and time; the battery's power level; how many minutes until the charging is complete; whether it's charging in Speed, Continue, or Trickle mode; and ads. Perhaps worse than the ad is that many users are reporting that clicking and holding onto the ad opens the ad and bypasses the lockscreen altogether - that's right, SpeedCharge may allow the phone to be used without a fingerprint scan or a lockscreen password.I have compiled a list of the apps that are mentioned the most often that have SpeedCharge. If you know of other apps, please do respond so we can get a complete list. I personally recommend the uninstalling of these apps, but if you do need to use them - some of them are apps that work well - see if you can turn off SpeedCharge in the apps' settings.Culprits may be:Amber Weather WidgetES Global (of note: ES File Explorer and ES App Locker)GO apps (of note: GO Weather, GO SMS, GO Keyboard, Next Browser)KittyPlay Wallpapers RingtonesTouchPal apps (TouchPal makes multiple keyboard apps)PIP Camera-Photo Editor ProZero Team apps (of note: Z Camera)Other notes:-In addition to SpeedCharge, there is a similar lockscreen takeover called BoostCharge. The culprits named above may display SpeedCharge, BoostCharge, or both.-Anti-virus and anti-malware apps, including Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, do not detect this adware.-I experienced this issue personally, and based on three hours of research, it seems like thousands of people have had this adware-related issue. I looked through reports made by thousands of users in over 30 threads spanning 9 websites and forums.This issue isn't exclusive to certain Android smartphones - many of the threads are posted in subforums of specific phone manufacturers and models - because it's due to the installation of apps.-SpeedCharge is on other apps that are not mentioned above. If you do not have any of the following apps installed, I found a way to detect which of your installed apps may have SpeedCharge (this took me way too long to figure out on my own, and no one seems to have mentioned it). To do so, you'll want to see the list of running apps in Developer Options, then look for any apps running ChargeLockerService. (This message of mine is already very long, so if you need help with Developer Options, post a response and I'll reply.)I hope this helps!

The worst thing is no credits is given in most of the apps and most of them have tons of ads in them.I have contacted Google and reported copyright violations multiple times but no action has been taken on any of the apps. I even made a list of apps that I was able to find just by searching Timber on play store that are exact copies.(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GOTGib-RBKDVWcQXA6Ti3kKZgtDFA9Trvaid9hc-9_s/edit?usp=sharing)There is even a copy that is published by a 'Top Developer' on Google play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zentertain.music.player) with 1 million+ installs and fake screenshots in play store.One developer has even provided fake support email on play store. I tried contacting developers directly warning them to make their apps compatible with GPL and the mail server didn't exist.Timber is licensed under GPL and none of the apps are following the license and are earning money ripping off the work of other developers .I am not even sure what I can do except leave FOSS altogether.

-Jun12 02:18SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/39iqw1/ive_built_an_ios_app_that_helps_you_build_good/SUBM_TXTFirst off, thanks guys. I've learnt a lot from the discipline & productivity subs and have received a hell of a lot of support. I'm glad I can give something back here with free upgrades (although I happily admit that the exposure certainly won't do me any harm).**So the new app is named Productive, and you can check it out here**http://itunes.apple.com/app/id983826477**Once installed, tap this link on your iOS device to get a free upgrade**[productive://unlock/thankyoureddit](http://productiveapp.io/upgrade-for-reddit.html) - There is no confirm screen, but as long as tapping the link opens the app, you are upgraded (you may need to hit back to go to the home screen again).**What makes it awesome?**The main thing that separates Productive from other habit trackers is the ability to plan your day by morning, afternoon, and evening. This helps you create little routines throughout the day that the beta testers found a lot easier to stick to than the regular old big list of tasks. It also means your habit list becomes less stressful - When you are doing your morning routine, you don't have to worry about the 11 other habits due later in the day. Of course, it also has all the other features you would expect from a great habit app: calendars, flexible scheduling, streaks, and a beautiful design.**Android users**I'm sorry that this is iOS only. I wish I had enough time and knowledge to develop for both platforms but as a solo developer this can be really really hard. I am looking for a partner to work on this with though, so if you are awesome at Android, and passionate about productivity / life improvement, feel free to shoot me a PM :).**Some backstory**About 2 years ago I released an app to help people do more of the things they love in their life. I never intended for that app to be a habit app, but quite a lot of people started using it that way. Unfortunately, a lot of the habit related features that users were asking for just didn't fit into that original app. Productive is a blend of that original app (Balanced), with the features that users kept asking for, that just didn't make sense in Balanced**Finally**You are welcome to share the upgrade with any friends, family, or even subreddits that you think might benefit from it. The free upgrades are permanent, but this code will probably stop giving free upgrades in about 2 weeks.

I literally can't reply anymore.. And it's been 24 hours so this offer is now off the table. Thanks for all the support you lovely people! You can still try the free version: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habitbull-habit-tracker/id1041482672?ls=1&mt=8**First of all, thanks for all your help guys. You gave me lots of feedback for the Android version and motivated me to keep working on it :)&nbsp;I finally decided to learn how to program in Swift and make an iOS version. The last 5 months were spent programming like crazy with LOTS of ups and downs.&nbsp;**To get free upgrade to premium (for both Android and iOS because hell why not!)**&nbsp; * Download the app here: [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habitbull-habit-tracker/id1041482672?ls=1&mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oristats.habitbull) * When opening the app either click "Register with email" or "Connect with Facebook" (you need to register for premium because it includes cloud backup and syncing with other devices etc) * *Send me the email address or facebook name you registered with -> habitbull@gmail.com* * Wait for confirmation email :)&nbsp;**What can HabitBull do for you?**&nbsp;It helps you form a routine. For example if you want to go running 2x per week then it lets you track how well you are doing. People use it for a lot of different things: *dieting, reading, studying a new language, meditation, flossing and even nofap..*&nbsp;**Why should you give it a try?**&nbsp;It has a long history on Android with lots of improvements along the way, has been downloaded almost 300.000 times with a rating of 4.5/5. There are no ads at all. It's now multi-platform and it has discussion forums, motivational images, a calendar for each habit separately, reminders, notes, cloud backup & sync etc. I have personally changed a lot of my own habits because of it - but obviously I'm biased so don't listen to me, see for yourself :)&nbsp;**The free upgrade is permanent, no tricks, no strings attached. Enjoy and thanks for all the support :)**
-Dec31 19:59SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1u3wq6/wanted_to_fill_everyone_in_on_the_system_i_use_to/SUBM_TXTSo - thanks to /r/productivity I've been trying and experimenting with tons of tools to get organized. Since highschool this has been a major downfall. Now 25 and in a full time job/busy life - it's a major detriment to my work. I tried tons of to-do lists. Every single one of them. Google tasks, etc. I then shifted over to Evernote and read a few books on how to best use Evernote to stay organized/focused and categorize everything.Evernote just didn't work for me. It was too much. I had too many tags, too many notebooks, too many stacks, and it inevitably ended up being what I wanted to avoid - cluttered. Not only that - The web app isn't great and i'm not particularly fond of the android app. They do great stuff on iOS and Mac but everything else left me feeling so 'meh.'I then started to use Trello. (http://www.trello.com) Trello has organized my life and helped me get more done/reach more life goals than I ever have.My system is as follows:I have 'Boards' for my Personal Life, my freelance work, and my full time work. Inside of each I have the following Lists:Inbox, Today, This Week, This Month, Done, Daily. Inbox - is just a general area for me to quickly jot things down that can be later organized and categorized. I try and keep ‘ideas’ out of here and just leave Trello as a space for ‘actionable’ stuff. Today - is stuff that I absolutely have to get done today. This week - self explanatory.Same with This Month.Done - is critical for me. It’s important to be able to look through a long list and see all that i’ve done. There’s also nothing more freeing than dropping something from ‘Today’ all the way over to ‘done.’ It’s one of the main rewards.That's one of the issues I also had with To Do lists. The ‘strike through’ wasn't that gratifying for me.  And it was harder to just scroll through and see all that you’ve done. Daily - I use the color labels for this section. Yellow means not done - green means done. I keep all of my ‘daily personal goals’ yellow until I complete one and then quickly label it green. For instance:“Read 30 minutes , take dog for walk, exercise, curse less, drink more water, check mint…” are all here. Now - one of the most critical parts of this system using Trello is to spend 15 minutes in the morning reviewing it. No distractions. I go through each and every board and just do an overall evaluation. It helps me keep the big picture in focus and push hard to achieve my goals. I do this around 5:30 am when our house is sleeping and I can just have my cup of coffee and focus on nothing but Trello. I don’t open reddit. No news. Absolutely nothing. It helps me immensely. You should do this too. I use Trello for ‘actionable’ items and Google Drive for most else. I take photos of all my receipts, transactions, bills, etc and store them in my ‘finances’ folder. Googles image search is truly amazing. I have separate folders for ‘things I like’ or ‘places I want to travel’ Google docs is very powerful for using things like this. Not only that - it’s cloud based (obviously). I also have different folders for everything (much like different boards) Personal - Freelance - Full Time job. I also have a folder just for my ‘inbox’ which are quick things to remember.My main issue - Web clipper. There is no web clipper for GDrive (that works...well) and this I miss a ton from evernote. Saving stories/articles/etc. I suppose chrome just wants you to use bookmarks but I already have too many and i suppose this is one more thing i need to structure and organize.Sorry if this is confusing to anyone. I am happy to take any questions. I hope this helps someone out.

-Apr04 09:27SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/63cp7k/best_phone_for_a_minimalist/SUBM_TXTI am looking to get a new phone in May and am still torn between all the different brands that are available. I have been asking advice from friends, colleagues, tech geniuses, people in the phone stores etc. I have gotten a pretty good understanding of all the technical specifications of the different phones, but there is one aspect they never understand and can not tell me, because they do not know anything about minimalism...I want to have a phone that can be as minimalist, non-distracting and clean as possible. I don't use tons of apps, but when I use them they need to be somewhere where I can find them fast - and I want to be able to not be bothered by the ones I don't use.A lot of people say iPhone is great since it looks clean, has a nice design and doesn't bother you with a lot of options. Other people say I should go for an Android phone because you are able to customize every single thing to your liking. (I still use a Samsung Galaxy S4 at the moment, so basically every phone would be an upgrade)I am just wondering if some of you have had the same question and if there's something you could tell me about it.
-Apr03 19:37SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/organization/comments/638bjj/trouble_with_google_photos_backup_fix_or_find/SUBM_TXTDear reddit,I am a person who wants to organize their life starting with the huge pile of files that I've stacked up over the years, that are dispersed and need to be sorted into appropriate folders using a chosen system of organization in mind (which is not the subject of this question/post).A big portion of these files is tons and tons ... and tons of photos and videos, which go into two MAIN categories with a lot of subcategories for both, and those are: personal photos and videos shot by myself or my friends as well as screenshots of things that are relevant to me in some way AND the other category would be best described by "Anything else", everything from infographics to animal photos, from art to :$oops :$, from memes to deep meaningful quotes.I've decided, for a while now, to crack down on getting things in order even if it will require me effort and time because the lack of organization in my life is making it very hard for me to move on and get things that matter done... and of course my personal files matter to me, especially my memories. It might be a good idea to also mention that I have OCD, although this is a problem anyone else can face, and many do.I spent some time researching and decided to start using Lightroom (adobe). Long story short, recently I got fed up with it being too "professional" as I am not a photographer and I don't want all these features, I just want something for my level, something intuitive that allows me to save time and facilitates the process of achieving and surpassing an organized database of my media files. Why? Because, although I've taken so many over all these years, I've never been able to enjoy ANY but the ones I stumble upon by accident because I cannot stand the sheer volume that I have to work on.I went back searching for solutions on google to eventually find that Google Photos was something that was more that I expected, I tried it with a couple of folders and was amazed at what it can do in terms of indexing by facial recognition, places, things, etc. and how it consistently automatically produces nice gifs, animations, names albums, etc. I was hooked. The features were mostly unavailable for my country, so I also spent time fixing that (VPN...). Getting ready to "move in" I hit a wall with this backup error that I have found NO SOLUTION for online, anywhere. On my Android (S7 edge, latest Nougat version), the backup remains stuck for a while at "x photos left", it's so disappointing. I think all of these 11 items (sometimes vary, +/-) are videos, but it is not the internet connection as many videos have already made it and synced. I left it overnight, nothing. Googled every solution possible, from Google's own FAQ and guides to google forums and other webpages, nothing (most suggesting clearing data, and/or manipulating things in settings). I've noticed that I am not the only person with this problem as there are many other people complaining from all over the world about this unresolved issues despite attempts to help from experts (nothing helpful on reddit either).I was finally so close to get things up and running at least, but it seems like it was for nothing. My other issues with Google Photos is 1- some minor issues on Windows, 2- the inability to hide certain photos or to have a private mode in case I want to open my account and show people albums and I don't want something embarrassing to show up. Also, 3- the inability to separate into 2+ categories the main "photos" area which where things are divided according to date, for example, the two above mentioned categories, one for which dates matter a lot, the other for which dates do not matter at all, only theme and subject.Final thing to mention, I have two choices to make, either I abandon google photos because it seems like this issue isn't being resolved and I don't know if the bug is going to be fixed anytime soon, or I switch to an entirely different service. I would also like to mention that the cloud service itself is not my priority here, it is the sorting, organization and recognition that are (and tagging, multiple selection, etc, available in other options). I could use a local backup method, no problem. I searched for something that could compete with Photos and Lightroom and honestly didn't find what I was looking for, everything was either outdated, not really good for organization, wastes too much time or costs too much money. What would you do at this point to follow through your goal?TL;DR: Google Photos has a serious bug that hasn't been fixed, it's related to syncing on android and even other devices, this is a dealbreaker even if you don't want to sync videos because it keeps trying to backup "forever"... what to do? Is there anything I could do to work around this or is there some great software out there that could address my concerns and help me organize my photos efficiently and effectively (even if differently)? Thank you!!!

Is there anyway to fix this?This issue only seems to occur after the last 2.5.X update. Any help would be greatly​ appreciated. Edit: Version number correction. 
-Apr09 02:32SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/64ae7u/does_anyone_here_use_letgo_why_is_it_any_better/SUBM_TXTI just came across the LetGo app. I was wondering if this was another great idea that goes no where kind of thing. I haven't installed or tried it yet, because I'm tired of creating accounts and getting spammed by services that i uninstalled immediately. 
-Apr08 19:07SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/648409/one_note_alternative/SUBM_TXTI wanted to get organized at work and stop using post it notes and hanging file folders for projects when most of the information was on the internet or n my PC in the first place and i can quickly adapt to typing my notes instead of handwriting. Having the multiple platform allows me to take my phone throughout the plant and add in typed, written, or voice notes, even take a pic/video for references.However after a month i both love and hate one note. I know that 80% of the problem is the device and corporate computer settings but i need to probably move on and find something similar at this point because i like the idea and it is going to help me.Problems encountered: One note on PC and laptop on web version are kind of slow and the laptop won't synch.Program download on pc initially couldn't login because of third party email being filtered on PC but eventually i made it though anyway and managed to keep myself logged in. This is now the only environment i can use all features and enjoy all of the benefits. Synchs good.Laptop downloaded version won't synch ever.  Probably a setting i may find someday if i try.Android web version. Can login but can never go further than two clicks into any area and it hangs.Biggest frustration is downloaded app on android will only run 5% of the time. Usually when i start i get the purple splash screen then just a black screen that almost locks up my phone. Have to force stop. Have tried uninstall twice and have tried clearing data every time i try to use it. In that case i can usually log back in and use it for one session but that's a lot to wipe that data every time and there is no guarantee i will get in by doing that. Android 4.4.4.So at my desk it is helpful and 90% reliable. When the phone will work my pc and phone synch well. But if i get up from my desk there is a 95% chance i can't add a quick entry to my to do list or look up anything or put a picture in a project. I have to walk around with pen and paper or use vice recorder, etc. Then go to the trouble of entering it to my pc to keep up to date.Any last ideas for one note problems?Really came here to ask what other program can i try that has many of the same features with multiple platform support?
-Apr08 20:58SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/648pz0/which_android_smart_watches_have_certain_alarms/SUBM_TXTHello all! I was diagnosed with ADHD for some time now but never thought about getting a smartwatch until just now. I had an account before but would you believe it I forgot my password :(&nbsp;**Are there smart watches that have autorestart timers?**&nbsp;- For **regular timers** such as the Android Timer when you swipe, you have to manually restart.You can dismiss in the lock screen but to restart you have to unlock it and then press restart.&nbsp;- For **pomodoro timers**, they go to the next thing (either break or work) without asking you to dismiss.Thus you don't necessarily get the reminder.&nbsp;**I want a timer that asks me to dismiss but restarts right away.** &nbsp;That kind of timer I stupidly didn't realize sooner could be an **alarm with predefined snooze**. I used to use the standard timer in Android but now I use an alarm (I use '[I can't wake up](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kog.alarmclock&hl=en)' for my waking up alarm so I also use it as a vibrating autorestart timer).&nbsp;So yeah, if not autorestart timers how about **vibrating alarms with several snoozes allowed**?&nbsp;I need at least 18 snoozes because I work part time at an education centre wherein I need an alarm to go off (but vibrate not ring to not distract students!) every 5 minutes to give me a proper sense of time. I usually get my phone out of my pocket to ~~dismiss the timer~~ I mean snooze the alarm ;) or leave my phone on the table.

-Mar11 18:54SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/5ytvlr/advice_there_is_no_limit_to_how_much_you_can_fuck/SUBM_TXTEdit: Below I wrote some more detailed advice how to not fuck around so much. Limit your time on the internet. StayFocusd for Chrome, Rescue time, Quality time for Android could help do that. Set yourself a daily limit like 2-1 hrs per day for time wasting sites and apps. When you have to study or do anything else don't pick up your phone mindlessly or turn on your computer. Just sit and do nothing. After few minutes the pain of doing nothing will be bigger than actually doing what you have to do.Make detailed plans. Determine the amount of time for each task.  Doesn't matter if they would be unrealistic or if you wont be able to stick to them. Any plan, even a stupid one is better than no plan at all. Meanwhile tweak and adjust your plan to be more realistic and doable.If you can't make yourself a plan get a plan. Google: 'plan for workout', 'plan for writing an essay', 'plan for cleaning my room'.Follow the plan for some time. If the plan your're following doesn't yield you results, change the plan.During exectuing your plan the feelings, distractions and emotions will approach you. Say 'fuck it I got a plan right?' and stick to your plan as best as you can. In those moments it's good to turn your brain off, dont't overthink stuff and just do it. https://youtu.be/hHGvgX0vDlI?t=2m35sFollow your plan no matter how shitty the outcome would be. It's better to have shitty results at the begining than no results at all. Apply the 'shitty first drafts' rule.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbgqFQjT6wo
-Mar06 14:58SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/5xtc0y/advice_i_got_in_the_trap_of_constantly_buying_new/SUBM_TXTI've basically wasted money in a combination of foolishness and bad luck.I bought a Chromebook at launch and an early gen Fire tablet because they were cheap, so I bought an excessive $800 PC tower  which had hardware failure.  $200 monitor sits in garage.  I bought numerous accessories including a $100 external hard drive, which weren't necessary.  Learning my lesson I bought a bulky laptop midrange for $500, which crapped out after a year.  Now, I mainly do my computing on an android tablet, which has very good performance but lacks in battery life and definitely missing key features which full computers have.  I've also had to buy many different little accessories to supplement the weaknesses of these electronics.  In the past few years I bought PS3 (sold it), Xbox One (kind of regret), 3DS (dust collector) and Wii U.  I wish I just had bought a PS4 and then a Switch.  And let's not even get into all of the impulsive Steam sales and $60 games I barely played.I want a PS4/Switch, but buying even more consoles is silly.  I'm going to need an actual full-computer device for producing and recording music, but I don't want to do anymore stopgap purchases.  I'm thinking of just saving up for a Mac, paying the extra money and hopefully never having to worry about quality issues again.  But how do I enjoy tech without getting into this cycle?

Google Keep calls this "Delete checked items", and it's amazing.  Google Keep has several limitation and In my opinion has a poor interface.  If anyone knows of a different app with this "delete completed items" option, that would be great.Thanks!
-Feb28 07:45SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/5wmixg/running_your_day_on_timers/SUBM_TXTI've been thinking about how I can structure my day around timers.What I want is to wake up and start a 16 hour timer that counts down until when I go to sleep again. However, along this timer, I want to have sub-timers that times various tasks during the day.An example would be. I start the 16 hour timer and that will always be visible in the corner or something. When I start this main timer, I want a sub-timer to start as well, counting down 15 minutes for how long I can spend waking up, or whatever. After those 15 minutes, a new sub-timer starts for showering + taking care of myself to get ready for the day. After that, there may be no sub-timer for a while until lunch hits and an hours sub-timer starts for lunch after which a new sub-timer for 30 minutes starts for reading.I have been trying to find a timer app, website or PC program that can do this, but without much success. After about an hour of searching, the best I have found so far is [this app (for android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intervaltimerfree.app&hl=en). But it can't do all the things that I wish for. It doesn't seem to show the upcoming task, for example. The app is made for exercise, so it's understandable.What do you think of this idea? I will schedule a timer for tomorrow with this app and write about my results. If you know any better software or can find some, please please let me know, I need this.
-Apr11 21:15SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/64t0m5/no_computer_at_home/SUBM_TXTDisclaimer: I have a laptop at work that I use.      I recently moved out from my parents place and one of the many items I decided not to bring along was my computer. It was an old POS that could not do anything more than browse the internet and the occasional Microsoft office work. It's been two months since I moved and I am surprised at how little need I have for a computer in the evenings and weekend. I realize that my phone (Nexus 6P) can do almost everything I need. I ChromeCast to my TV for YouTube, Netflix and can also cast my screen if I'm streaming from another app or browser. I also have ChromeCast audio hooked to my sound bar to play music. Browsing the web, online shopping, social media, emails can all be done on my phone though the search function on the gmail android app is so bad I can't use it.       All in all, I'm really happy with the space I saved as I've saved a ton of space by not needing a desk in my room to setup a PC. Anyone have similar experiences?

-Apr16 04:34SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/65myt0/moodo_review_integrated_task_list_gmail_calendar/SUBM_TXTHi all,if you are not familiar with Moo.do, it is a Chrome, Android and IOS based information management tool.  It consists of "panes", that comprise either an outline task list, Calendar, Gmail or even Google Drive.  Mac and Windows native Apps are in the works.  I recently completed a review of it at,http://donebeforebrekky.com/moo-do-review/Key points:1. Integrated outline task list, Calendar, Gmail or even Google Drive.  Can drag and drop between them.2. Free, $69/yr. pricing.   The main benefit that you will get is the Calendar and Google Drive functionality, both of which are lacking in the free version3. Tasks can be easily added anywhere in the list and indented or out dented to define their level in the hierarchy4. Tags can be added by simply using the age old hash key. Dates for the tasks can be defined using the @ symbol and naturally having entered the date, this will show up as an entry in the calendar view.5.  Files can be easily uploaded by dragging them to this window and also opened directly from here using Google docs or other online tools. 6. Task lists can be shared by entering the settings for the list and entering the emails of the collaborators7. You can filter by task importance, starred, completed of email.  
-Apr17 14:02SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/65v4kt/method_wake_up_motivated_and_inspired_every_day/SUBM_TXT1. Download an alarm clock app that lets you play a playlist of songs from your phone. I use [Sleep As Android](http://sleep.urbandroid.org/en/) because as an added bonus it makes you do math (which forces your brain into a higher level of functioning) before you can turn off the alarm.2. Find a bunch of motivational/inspirational YouTube videos that speak to you. I'm talking about the over-the-top ones with Dwayne Johnson and Joe Rogan and TED talks telling you that success is 90% about showing up every day and doing the work. 1-3 minute videos work best. Choose at least 5-7 so you can wake up to a slightly different message every day of the week.3. Go to a [YouTube to mp3 converter](http://www.youtube-mp3.org) and download the audio to your phone. 4. In your phone's native music player app, create a playlist with just those inspirational/motivational tracks, then select that playlist in your alarm clock app.5. Turn off the Snooze option and the vibrate option. This is about getting up early and getting motivated, so you want to be able to listen to the whole 1-3 minutes without your phone vibrating like crazy.6. Go to bed early enough to get a full night's sleep, and minimize screen time and entertainment for an hour before sleep. Drink a litre of water before bed (having to pee in the morning can be an added incentive to get out of bed, plus you're progeny not drinking enough water anyway. Dehydration can cause headaches and malaise that can make getting out of bed harder).7. Sit up when the alarm goes off, and drink a litre of water right away.8. Do some basic stretches right away. I like to do some neck rotations, [scalene stretches](https://youtu.be/E5AJlLAmWxU) and [toe touches](https://youtu.be/XHSLeoy6I5s). The last one is helpful because you have to stand up. Don't touch your bed again. 9. If you're studying or trying to learn something, spend 5 minutes reviewing your notes from the preview day's study. Don't try to learn anything new. This is about reinforcing the neural pathways for information you plan on keeping forever. Note the stuff you're getting stuck on so you can study it in depth later.10. If you have weights at home, work out, or do yoga, or do a stretching routine, or go for a walk, or a run. Do something to move your body. Study after study has shown that physical exercise has positive impacts on our mental health, and improves our ability to think clearly, to learn, and to improve our mood. You need to move every day. While you're moving, keep going over the study review in your head.11. ~~Stop drinking~~ *cut back on* caffeine. I'm sorry. I love(d) it too, but too much caffeine is bad for your body and mind, it teaches you to rely on a stimulant to wake up, and the new you doesn't need it anymore. Caffeine messes with your body's natural energy production, increases anxiety and stress response, results in energy crashes when it wears off, and builds a dependency on an external stimulant to energize your mind. It took me three tries and weaning through half-caf for months in order to avoid the withdrawal headaches, but I've never felt better! I still drink decaf because I love the flavor. YMMV.**Do this every day.**In the beginning you might stumble. That's fine, get back up the next day, but know that this is your new life. Edit: touched a nerve with the coffee comment. Yes, decaf contains *some* caffeine. Sorry I wasn't clear abbot that. What I'm really advocating is removing the dependence on a stimulant to wake yourself up or to stay alert.Edit 2: some hastily gathered samples of motivational content (post comments with your own preferred, and better content!):- https://youtu.be/9G3e06N4qSs- https://youtu.be/xp2qjshr-r4- https://youtu.be/V6xLYt265ZM- https://youtu.be/26U_seo0a1g- https://youtu.be/z1PSbDmV8Gw
