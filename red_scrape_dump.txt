-Mar31 01:03SUBM_ID62hieaSUBM_TIT[REQUEST] Collecting/Collection Type gameSUBM_TXTI've been looking for a good collecting/collection type game, Where just open boxes/crates/packs etc. And get different rewards with different varying degrees of rarity or worth. I have a few where it's the good old RPG hero collection but i wan't something less RPG/Dungeon based. I Tried Packrat but Found it very convulated and am looking for something a lot more simplistic.Trading and or selling in game is also a bonus.p.s I already have 3 different RPG games where you collect Heros and level them up. Looking for something different then that.A LOT of items is a plus 800+(Do not say the cat collection or claw games)
-Mar30 00:20SUBM_ID629y7rSUBM_TITRemix Player is an ugly, horribly outdated (2011) Music Player with an unique and essential featureSUBM_TXThttps://youtu.be/LDHmS_aAQWEFull control of your Music player while using other apps/home screenAnd no, I'm not talking about pause/skip track on the notification tray. I'm talking it's own slider just for the Music Player. I'm talking full control: Shuffle, Choose track/album/playist/author from a list, skip time in track... Without having to exit/switch app what I'm currently using. I've been waiting over half a decade now for a proper implementation...

Is anyone here familiar with a blocklist or an alternative app that's successful in eliminating the new mid-roll ads?  I know 5 Hour Energy is great and all, but I'm already a customer and don't want that shit RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY VIDEOS, ZUCK.

-Mar26 21:35SUBM_ID61ng60SUBM_TITDecent SMS app?SUBM_TXTMaybe it's just be but I'm struggling to find an SMS app that works the way I want. I'm sure everyone has different needs in their app but I can't find a single app that does what I want or at least consistently delivers.Wish list in an app:I want an app that doesn't have too much extras like stickers etc like gosms.I want an app with a black theme. Would settle for dark.I want an app that has swipe to return.I want an app that looks clean.I want an app that has GIF support.I don't want conversation view in my heads up notifications. Or at least a way to toggle it off.When I respond I want the notification to dissapear.My top apps are Yataa Awsms MysmsHowever all of these fall short in one way or another.Does anyone have suggestions? Perhaps an app in beta or one I've never heard of?I know alternative messaging apps may deliver, but I need SMS.
Mar29 18:44SUBM_ID627so1SUBM_TITSchedule/Time Management App?SUBM_TXTLately I've been really trying to get a handle on my ADHD by implementing some changes, however i am struggling with some of them which include time management and the 'oh look a squirrel' behavior. Looking for an app (android) that can help with daily tasks/reminders. If possible, also able to access it on computer I don't know that it would necessarily be a to do list in the sense that many are reoccurring tasks, some on certain days, others not so much, but I could be wrong. I don't need it down to the level of 'brush teeth' and 'eat' but more like from 5:30-7:00 is study time, 9:00-9:15 plan tomorrow, etc. I would appreciate and and all feedback as well as open to any suggestions on helping with this. 
-Mar29 16:26SUBM_ID626xo9SUBM_TITHelp. I need a ticking timer Android app, but with half-second ticking sounds.SUBM_TXTI love Tomighty for my PC.  But it's not great in an office environment, or if I have headphones on.  Every Android timer app I've found with ticking sounds, ticks too slowly. Like once a second.  I need at least twice, or I feel like I'm being slowed down/pulled backwards?Any app suggestions?  Anyone feel similar?

Help?SUBM_TXTDo any of you know of or utilize any ways to bullet journal using the PC, or *maybe* the Android? I am very attracted to the idea of bullet journaling, but, due to a muscular disease, I am unable to use an actual notebook. Can anyone help me? :) Thank you!
