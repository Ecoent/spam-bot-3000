-Mar31 05:27SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/62ivl8/top_10_trivia_app_idea/SUBM_TXTI have started to create a trivia app similar to [Fight List](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.two4tea.fightlist&hl=en). It's basically the same thing but it's just a top 10 list for each round and the player earns more points for the higher up answers in the top 10. Example: Top 10... Largest US States by AreaTexas = 10 pointsCalifornia = 9 points...Wyoming = 1 pointWhat do you guys think about this idea? Is top 10 a bad idea?I'm starting to feel like it might take too much time to gather and mange top 10 info. Also there might not be that many top 10's out there that aren't always changing.
-Mar28 05:18SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/61wyob/adaway_blocklist_for_facebooks_new_midroll_ads/SUBM_TXTI looked around to no avail, so I figured I'd ask Reddit.  Is anyone here familiar with a blocklist or an alternative app that's successful in eliminating the new mid-roll ads?  I know 5 Hour Energy is great and all, but I'm already a customer and don't want that shit RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY VIDEOS, ZUCK.

Would settle for dark.I want an app that has swipe to return.I want an app that looks clean.I want an app that has GIF support.I don't want conversation view in my heads up notifications. Or at least a way to toggle it off.When I respond I want the notification to dissapear.My top apps are Yataa Awsms MysmsHowever all of these fall short in one way or another.Does anyone have suggestions? Perhaps an app in beta or one I've never heard of?I know alternative messaging apps may deliver, but I need SMS.

-Mar25 22:38SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/61hpor/just_bought_my_4th_android_and_want_to_change_all/SUBM_TXTHi guys, (disclaimer: Sorry if this is the wrong sub and I checked the wiki but couldn't see anything like this)So I realised that I've basically just pootled along with whatever worked when I gave up ios 10 years ago and didn't understand android. Now that I've got a new Sony zx I realised this is the perfect time to streamline how I use android. For example, I've been using aviate launcher because it works and is pretty minimal. But I've spent the afternoon looking at nova and its crazy feature list and have to give this a go: customise my os to my behaviors, choose my preferred designs etc. Rather than having it spoon fed to me.So what are your Android pro tips? Automation? Preferred dialers? Keyboards? Camera apps? Media players? Things I don't even know about?! Thanks you guys!

Rather than just having a linear list of tasks, my app sorts them based on their importance and urgency.

-Mar23 12:36SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/6112hs/workoutgym_app_recommendations/SUBM_TXTI'm looking for an app to organize my workouts day to day to focus on specific muscle groups on certain days.I've just kept a Keep note of them for the past year, but as my list getting longer and longer it gets confusing to keep track of.Is there an app that I can schedule certain workouts, so I can interchange them throughout the week?

-Mar29 18:44SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/627so1/scheduletime_management_app/SUBM_TXTLately I've been really trying to get a handle on my ADHD by implementing some changes, however i am struggling with some of them which include time management and the 'oh look a squirrel' behavior. Looking for an app (android) that can help with daily tasks/reminders. If possible, also able to access it on computer I don't know that it would necessarily be a to do list in the sense that many are reoccurring tasks, some on certain days, others not so much, but I could be wrong. I don't need it down to the level of 'brush teeth' and 'eat' but more like from 5:30-7:00 is study time, 9:00-9:15 plan tomorrow, etc. I would appreciate and and all feedback as well as open to any suggestions on helping with this.

But it's not great in an office environment, or if I have headphones on.  Every Android timer app I've found with ticking sounds, ticks too slowly. Like once a second.  I need at least twice, or I feel like I'm being slowed down/pulled backwards?Any app suggestions?  Anyone feel similar?

-Feb28 23:43SUBM_URLhttps://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal/comments/5wr0fi/bought_an_iphone_and_completely_stopped_using_my/SUBM_TXTI recently switched from iPhone from Android and it's made me stop journaling. I had been using my journal for about 8 months and I haven't used it for at least a month. On the Android system everything felt so separate but with iOS everything feels connected. I can make pretty detailed lists and quick to do lists in notes, the reminder system is great and the calander system is workable.I'm feeling guilty for not using my beloved paper journal but it's so much easier for me to just tap out a quick grocery list or easily update my budget note! My favorite part, and something that was bothering me about my paper journal, is that once I'm done with the list I can just swipe and delete it. It's not sitting around taking up space that I have to see everyday once it's not relevant.I guess it's a form of journaling, and I feel bad for abandoning my actual journal but it works for me and that's what's important!
